Project 3 readme

I ran all notebooks in Google Colab, you should be able to Run all code in each of the notebooks in Colab to generate all plots and information used in the report. 

The main code of the project is contained in "P3-VDN-masteralgo.ipynb". The saved individual runs on each layout are located in "P3_VDN_L{layout#}_MARL.ipynb". You can see the results of the particular runs saved in each of those notebooks, or you can run the code in the masteralgo file by changing the layout specification and hitting run all. I also included various other files used for plotting, hyperparameter tuning, and aggregation of results. 

Thank you!
